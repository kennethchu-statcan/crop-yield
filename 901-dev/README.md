901-dev
=======
This task contains an automated pipeline that executes the source code
of the R package **stcCropYield** as stand-alone R scripts,
assuming the package has NOT yet been installed.
This pipeline was primarily used at the early phase of the development
of the R package, before it was in installable form.

How to execute the pipeline
---------------------------
Clone this repository to your computer, if not already done.

Change directory to the folder of this pipeline in the local cloned repository:

```
cd <LOCAL CLONED REPOSITORY>/901-dev/
```

If you are using a Linux or macOS computer, execute the following shell script:

```
.\run-main-dev.sh
```

If you are using a Windows computer, execute the following batch script
at the Command Prompt instead:

```
.\run-main-dev.bat
```
